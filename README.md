## Anagrams
Write a (console) program to solve anagrams.  

Given a word as input, the program should output all anagrams of that word according to the dictionary.


##  Word chains
Write a (console) program that solves word-chain puzzles.

Given two words as input - the starting word and the ending word, the program should output a chain of words from the dictionary.  Successive entries in the chain must all be real words, and each can differ from the previous word by just one letter. 

For example, given input
    
    cat dog

A valid output is

    cat cot cog dog
